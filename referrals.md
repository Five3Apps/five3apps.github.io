As you know, service businesses like mine grow primarily based on referrals. If you have a colleague, friends, a family member, or anyone else who is in need of help that I can provide, I invite you to connect them with me.

**My solemn promise to you is that I will provide them with whatever help I can to within the best of my abilities — and if I cannot help, I will do my best to connect them to someone who can.**

You’re reading this page because you’re a trusted friend, client, or colleague and you’re curious how to refer someone to me.

First off, let me thank you deeply. I appreciate any and all referrals that you are gracious enough to provide. You have my promise that any person you refer to me will be provided with whatever help I can to the best of my abilities.

If you’re curious about who would make an ideal referral and how to refer someone to me, read on. This has been one of the most frequently asked questions I’ve received and this page was written to give you helpful, specific instructions on how to refer someone you know.

# “Who should I refer to you?”
**My ideal clients are decision makers at a health and fitness wearables company (Garmin, Fitbit, etc).**

They’ve already shipped a wearable product to market and have revenue, or they're well funded and have a well defined market.

In addition, if there is anyone — for any reason — that you feel would benefit from being connected with me, you have my blanket permission to refer anyone and everyone to me, for whatever reason. I am always happy to make myself available to help someone that you refer to me, in whatever capacity that I can.

# What problems can Justin help with?
My ideal clients are looking for help:

- Understanding Bluetooth Low-Energy and how to best implement it in a wearable
- Advising firmware and software engineers on best practices
- Getting actionable feedback on improving the stability of their mobile app
- Review and optimization of their mobile app UX
- Building a mobile app that's modular and scalable

# “How should I refer people to you?”
Excellent question.

The best way to refer someone to me is to send them a link to my new client questionnaire. That is the best way for us to start the conversation, so I can best understand how I can help them and their business.

Send them a link to this page: [http://five3apps.com/apply/](http://five3apps.com/apply/)

Please let them know that when they fill out the questionnaire, they should put down your name as the person who referred them to me.

Below, I’ve included an email that you can copy and paste and send to anyone you’d like to refer to me.

# How does Justin help his clients?
My clients can benefit from development services or coaching/advising services. Services range from $1,500 one-time to $15,000/mo, depending on the scope of work. Typical development projects are in the $25,000 to $50,000 range.

All of my services are fixed-rate, so my clients never have to worry about the project costing more than expected.

# “How do I know who I should refer to you?”
An exercise that I often do when I’m thinking of who I can refer to my friends or my colleagues is this:

- I block out 20 minutes on my calendar
- I write down, on a piece of paper, the type of client that they work best with (In my case, that’s freelancers or consultants who want to get more clients without spending more on marketing)
- Then, I go through my contact list on my phone, in my address book, in my email client, and in my Facebook and for anyone that I think might be a good person to connect them with, I write down their name

In 20 minutes, I can have 5, 10, 20, or even more names written down to refer to a friend or colleague
I recommend that you do the same. Block out 20 minutes on your calendar and follow the above process. Then, for each person on your list, feel free to refer them to me or send them the referral introduction email below.

# “Do you have an email I can use to refer people to you?”
Absolutely — just copy and paste this, subbing in their name and the relevant bits (marked “[...]” so you can easily find them) and send the email off to someone that you’ve identified (CC or BCC’ing me, preferably, so I know that you’ve referred them to me and can prepare for them to reach out to me).

# Thank You
Referrals are an important part of my business. I deeply appreciate you taking the time to connect me with 2-3 (or more) of your colleagues and your friends. And if there is anyone I can refer to you, just email me and let me know and I’ll see who in my network is a match for your business.

Thanks!

— Justin
