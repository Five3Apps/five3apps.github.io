	<p>"While working on an app for UNICEF, the funding partners made a request to release the app much sooner than planned. We engaged Justin to <b>help us bring the mobile experience to market for nationwide holiday sales in a very tight timeframe.</b></p>

	<p>We had some hesitation around outsourcing a core part of our business. <b>I wasn’t sure how it would work out to have our main technical lead not be full-time</b> or how “external” Justin would seem. What gave me confidence to engage Justin was his reputation in our network and how he showed that he was clearly invested the success of the project. <b>From the early stages of working together, he demonstrated reliability and definitely shouldered responsibility for the project alongside the rest of the team.</b> It helped me sleep well at night knowing Justin was on it and that he was dedicated to making sure it was going to be a success.</p>

	<p><b>As a result of working with Justin, we made a vast amount of progress with a small team very quickly. We launched a stable app with a good experience on time.</b></p>

	<p>What I appreciated most about Justin’s service was <b>his willingness to dive into the deep work</b> and not just take short cuts. He thinks through the ramifications and creates a work plan, which gave us confidence that we had an app that would be stable and would be where we need it to be to scope a new feature.</p>

	<p>Justin’s personality and demeanor were a good fit and <b>he was great at coordinating and providing technical leadership.</b> He introduced a development team retrospective process, which gave the team members a great avenue to communicate their ideas and get feedback. That level of open communication made everyone feel good about the progress we were making.</p>

	<p><b>Justin has that high level of expertise and works closely with his clients.</b> Unlike an agency that might hand your project off to lower-level talent when something new comes in, which can slow things down, <b>Justin shares ownership of the project and deadlines.</b> I definitely would highly recommend him."</p>
