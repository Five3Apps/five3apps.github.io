  <h1>
    You've built an amazing wearable, but what will your users think?
  </h1>

  <p>You've spent countless hours creating a wearable device that's unique and has the power to change lives. But how much time have you spent on what's needed for your users to experience everything your wearable can do for them?</p>

  <!--<p>For most health and fitness wearables the power of the technology only comes alive through a mobile app. But building a smooth and actionable experience between a wearable and mobile app is challenging! It requires experience not only with app development, UX and design. But also Bluetooth low energy and often server and API development.</p>-->

  <p>Far too many incredible health and fitness wearables are hiding behind a sub-par mobile app experience. Users quickly become frustrated or worse yet are never fully engaged during onboarding. It's not long before you are yet another wearable tossed in the top dresser drawer.</p>

  <h4>Do you want to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars learning these lessons yourself and risking a loss of trust with your users?</h4>

  <p>Stand out from the crowd and build the mobile app your users can use to change their lives! Work with a wearables iOS app expert that has shipped projects for some of the biggest brands in the world.</p>

      I am an iOS consultant who helps health and fitness wearables companies build mobile experiences that retain more users. With over 10yrs of experience at the intersection of hardware and software, my goal is to use my expertise to provide your users with the best mobile experience possible.

      <p>I've worked with brands like Walmart, UNICEF, and Lucasfilm to build apps that impact millions of lives. Unlike other consultants, you’ll work directly with me instead of with junior employees who bill you hundreds of dollars per hour to learn on the job.</p>

      <p>I have been working with Bluetooth Low Energy since 2013 collaborating with HW and FW engineers to understand how to get reliable connections and performance. I have worked with Apple designers on the UX of an Apple Watch app, built apps using HealthKit on both iOS and WatchOS, and designed REST APIs that balance security and end user experience.</p>

      <p>Cheers!</p>
