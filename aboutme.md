Hey, I'm Justin Bergen a mobile consultant located in Front Range of the Colorado Rockies. My specialty is helping wearables companies build more engaging mobile apps.

My first tech memory is playing MoonPatrol on my grandmother's Apple ][. I have been a fan and user of Apple/Mac products ever since! My Objective­C development experience started back in 2009 when a friend an I decided to write a Mac app (Alesco Trade Journal) to solve a problem we had with our day trading hobbies. Ever since then I have been hooked on solving real­ world problems with technology.

When I'm not doing techie things, I can usually be found either playing with my 3 little boys, or enjoying everything the mountains have to offer ... or both. My favorite mountain sports right now are snowboarding, mountain biking, and backpacking/camping.
