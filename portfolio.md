_Star Wars: Force for Change_ and Target

#### My role (2015 - 2017)
I worked with the KidPower team to architect and implement the MVP around their existing BLE (sync) code. In mid-2016 I re-built the full BLE communication stack, virtually eliminating user issues around syncing.

Once Kid Power hired a full-time iOS developer I provided ongoing app engagement, technical and architectural guidance for their growing internal team.

I stepped back into a more hands-on role to architect and build Apple Health integration and an Apple Watch app to allow parents to more easily participate in the program along side their kids.

>I cannot recommend Justin more highly. He does not tolerate "good enough", especially of himself; he strives toward excellence. He believes in products that meet a genuine need, are intelligently designed, and are a pleasure to use. He'll take the time to make something the right way, the first time. Justin would be an invaluable asset to any organization for his energy, responsibility, and technical savvy, but I believe his desire to exceed expectations and pursue challenges is what truly sets him apart.

## Gloo
[gloo.us](http://grow.gloo.us/)

#### About the project

Gloo provides the infrastructure and tool sets to allow organizations to quickly deploy content on their own digital platform uniquely designed for growth.

#### My role (2013 - 2014)

During my time at Gloo I lead a team of 6 mobile developers through multiple major revisions of the Gloo native mobile apps. This involved an entirely new UI/UX, a separate rebrand effort, and implementation of a white labeling solution. I also contributed to the architecture and implementation of the iOS app, including an incremental rewrite of 90% of the app that resulted in >50% reduction of code!

> Justin is a solid engineer and natural leader, and his development skills speak for themselves. Justin is a great asset to any team, and I'd certainly work with him again in the future.
