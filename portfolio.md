#### About the project

Gloo provides the infrastructure and tool sets to allow organizations to quickly deploy content on their own digital platform uniquely designed for growth.

#### My role (2013 - 2014)

During my time at Gloo I lead a team of 6 mobile developers through multiple major revisions of the Gloo native mobile apps. This involved an entirely new UI/UX, a separate rebrand effort, and implementation of a white labeling solution. I also contributed to the architecture and implementation of the iOS app, including an incremental rewrite of 90% of the app that resulted in >50% reduction of code!
